# Using Web Pack:
Installing webpack:

>>>>    npm install webpack babel-loader webpack-dev-server --save-dev

Errors:
>>>> webpack
Webpack not found

Solutions:
Global Installation:
>>>>    sudo npm install -g webpack

Non Global Installation:
>>>>    ./node_modules/.bin/webpack

The CLI moved into a separate package: webpack-cli.
Please install 'webpack-cli' in addition to webpack itself to use the CLI.
-> When using npm: npm install webpack-cli -D
Try Following:

> Install Webpack 2 => npm install webpack@2
> Output file path should be absolute
> "loaders" keyword is replaced by "rules" keyword
> Remove "query" and "persist" section
> Remove Public path

Better option to continue with Webpack 4 is as follows: Install webpack, webpack-cli and webpack-dev-server together globally
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server -g

Then link global webpack to your Project
npm link webpack



To run webpack:
webpack --mode development

To run webpack continuously (Keep watching):
webpack --mode development -w




<> WHEN Running Apps, Run "start npm" in one CLI and "webpack -w" in another

Loading JSON with Webpack:

>>>>    npm install --save react react-dom (Then we can remove inline react inclusion calls in index.html)
Also Install Json Loader & update webpack config file

>>>>    npm install -save-dev json-loader

Error: Unexpected token m in JSON at position 0
Solution: Problem was in the import methodology, import json file as follows

var greetings = require('./titles.json')




Adding CSS using Webpack:
Also Install CSS loaders and update webpack config file

>>>>    npm install style-loader css-loader postcss-loader sass-loader node-sass --save-dev

module: {
        rules: [
            { 
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /(node_modules)/, 
                use: 'babel-loader' 
            }
            ,
            {   test: /\.css$/,  
                use: ['style-loader','css-loader'] 
            },
            {   test: /\.scss$/,  
                use: ['style-loader','css-loader','sass-loader'] 
            }
            
        ]
        }
